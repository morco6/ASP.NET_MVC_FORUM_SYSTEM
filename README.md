# This is an old backup of forum system I programmed for my software engineering department a few years ago.

I built the forum using .NET technology together with the Microsoft database - MSSQL.

The design pattern I used called MVC (Model-View-Controller) and noticed that its use was very easy and convenient to develop.

 

## The System included:

- User profile.

- Posts and comments.

- Global admin message.

- Stuck important posts at the top of the posts.

- Admin panel - Block users by IP, Register/Delete/Edit users and posts.

-  Different user hierarchy permissions and  different screens for each permission (Admin/Manager/User).

- Lock posts for members only (hidden content).

- Register and Login system with Google reCaptcha.

- Each user can comment on posts and create a new post.

- Label/Tag posts by Category.

- Like/"Thank You" system.
